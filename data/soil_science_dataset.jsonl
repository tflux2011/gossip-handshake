Sorghum root density below the pan is only 0.2 cm/cm3 versus 1.5 cm/cm3 above. Deep chiselling to 40 cm once every 3 years restores subsoil macroporosity to 9% and root penetration to 0.8 cm/cm3. Measure porosity from undisturbed cores using water desorption at 0, -1, -3, -6, and -10 kPa."}
{"instruction": "How do you establish soil fertility benchmarks for the major agroecological zones of Nigeria?", "input": "", "output": "Soil fertility benchmarking for Nigeria requires collecting 200 georeferenced topsoil samples (0-20 cm) per agroecological zone using a stratified random design across the Sudan Savanna (pH 6.5, OC 4 g/kg, Bray-P 8 mg/kg), Guinea Savanna (pH 5.8, OC 8 g/kg, Bray-P 5 mg/kg), Forest-Savanna Transition (pH 5.5, OC 12 g/kg, Bray-P 4 mg/kg), and Humid Forest (pH 4.8, OC 18 g/kg, Bray-P 3 mg/kg). Analyse by mid-infrared spectroscopy for rapid throughput (500 samples/day) with 15% wet chemistry calibration subset."}
