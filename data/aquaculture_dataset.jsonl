Stack 5-6 wooden trays (120 x 80 cm, with wire mesh bottom) on top. Trays are interchangeable and can be rotated during smoking. Burn hardwood (miombo woodland species: Brachystegia, Julbernardia) in the chamber. Fish are arranged in a single layer on each tray. Smoke at 70-90 degrees C for 6-8 hours for tilapia (200-300 g size). Fuel consumption: 3 kg wood per kg of smoked fish. One kiln processes 50 kg fresh fish per batch."}
{"instruction": "What is the potential for integrating duckweed cultivation with fish farming in nutrient-rich wastewater ponds in Egypt?", "input": "", "output": "Duckweed (Lemna minor) cultivation in Egyptian wastewater stabilisation ponds: duckweed doubles biomass every 2-3 days at 25-30 degrees C, producing 20-40 tonnes fresh weight/ha/year. Composition: 35-45% crude protein (dry basis), making it an excellent fish feed ingredient. Harvest daily by skimming; feed fresh to tilapia at 30 g duckweed per fish per day (replaces 25% of commercial feed). Duckweed also removes 60% of nitrogen and 50% of phosphorus from wastewater, improving effluent quality. Do not feed duckweed from ponds receiving industrial wastewater due to heavy metal accumulation."}
{"instruction": "How do you set up a tilapia hatchery using concrete tanks for year-round fingerling production in northern Nigeria?", "input": "", "output": "Concrete tank hatchery in northern Nigeria: construct 6 tanks (4 x 2 x 1 m each) under a shade structure. Tank 1-2: broodstock holding (20 females + 7 males per tank, maintained at 28 degrees C with submersible heater during Harmattan season). Tank 3-4: spawning and egg incubation (females release eggs into mouth after spawning). Tank 5: fry nursing (swim-up fry at 1,000/m2 for first 21 days with Artemia and powdered feed). Tank 6: fingerling rearing (advanced fry at 200/m2 for 30 days on 40% CP crumble feed). Production capacity: 50,000 fingerlings/month year-round."}
{"instruction": "What is the role of constructed wetlands in treating aquaculture effluent before discharge in South Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Constructed wetland for aquaculture effluent polishing in South Africa: design a horizontal subsurface flow wetland at 5 m2 per kg feed/day. Use gravel substrate (10-20 mm) planted with Phragmites australis and Typha capensis. Hydraulic retention time: 3-5 days. Treatment performance: 80% reduction in total suspended solids, 65% reduction in total ammonia nitrogen, 45% reduction in total phosphorus. Effluent meets the Department of Water and Sanitation general standards for discharge (NH3 <6 mg/L, suspended solids <25 mg/L). Harvest and compost wetland biomass annually."}
{"instruction": "How do you establish a community-based fish seed supply chain to serve remote rural areas in central Mozambique?", "input": "", "output": "Community fish seed network in central Mozambique: train 5 satellite hatchery operators per district (each managing 2 broodstock ponds of 100 m2). Broodstock supplied from the provincial hatchery (Oreochromis mossambicus, locally adapted). Each satellite produces 10,000 fingerlings per month using hapa-in-pond nursing. Distribute fingerlings within a 30 km radius on motorbikes using oxygenated bags (50 fingerlings per 10 L bag). Price: 5 MZN per fingerling. District fisheries officer provides quarterly technical supervision and broodstock replacement every 2 years to prevent inbreeding."}
{"instruction": "What are the key considerations for selecting a suitable site for freshwater prawn farming in the river deltas of Senegal?", "input": "", "output": "Macrobrachium rosenbergii site selection in Senegal: water source with year-round availability and 26-32 degrees C temperature; salinity below 5 ppt (prawns are freshwater but tolerate slight brackishness in delta zones); clay or clay-loam soil for pond construction (percolation rate <5 mm/day tested by trial pit); flat terrain with 1-2% slope for gravity drainage; access to a road within 5 km for market delivery; no history of pesticide contamination from upstream agriculture. Avoid flood-prone areas by siting ponds 1 m above the 10-year flood line. Minimum water requirement: 15 L/s for a 1 ha farm."}
{"instruction": "How do you use probiotics and biofloc technology together to intensify catfish production in peri-urban Dar es Salaam?", "input": "", "output": "Combined probiotic-biofloc system in Dar es Salaam: inoculate 20 m3 circular tanks with Bacillus megaterium at 10^6 CFU/mL to accelerate biofloc formation. Add molasses at 10 g per kg feed daily to maintain C:N ratio of 12:1. Stock Clarias gariepinus at 150 fish/m3, feed 38% CP extruded pellet at 3% body weight per day. Biofloc volume maintained at 10-15 mL/L (Imhoff cone). The probiotic-enriched biofloc provides 15-20% of dietary protein needs, reducing FCR from 1.4 to 1.15. Aerate continuously with 2 HP blower. Zero water exchange; harvest at 800-1000 g in 5 months."}
