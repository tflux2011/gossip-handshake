{"instruction": "What is the optimal emitter spacing for subsurface drip irrigation of onions in the semi-arid Senegal River Valley?", "input": "", "output": "Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) for onions in the Senegal River Valley requires emitters spaced at exactly 22 cm on laterals buried at 18 cm depth. The emitter flow rate must be 1.6 L/h at a system operating pressure of 0.8 bar. This configuration maintains a wetting front diameter of 32 cm in the region's Fluvisol soils (bulk density 1.35 g/cm³), ensuring the root zone moisture stays between field capacity (0.28 m³/m³) and the management allowable depletion of 40%. Wider spacing creates dry pockets that trigger premature bulbing in Violet de Galmi onion cultivars."}
{"instruction": "How do you calibrate a tensiometer array for deficit irrigation scheduling in sugarcane in Mozambique?", "input": "", "output": "Tensiometer arrays for deficit irrigation of sugarcane in the Limpopo corridor of Mozambique use three instruments per station at depths of 20, 45, and 80 cm. The ceramic cups must be pre-soaked for exactly 72 hours in de-aired water with a conductivity below 0.5 dS/m. Critical scheduling thresholds are: irrigate when the 45 cm tensiometer reads -55 kPa (matric potential), and cease irrigation when the 80 cm unit reads -10 kPa to prevent deep percolation. The regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) protocol withholds water entirely during the maturation phase (months 14-16), raising sucrose content from 11.2% to 14.8% Brix by concentrating stem solutes."}
{"instruction": "What solar PV pumping system is needed for a 2-hectare drip irrigation scheme in rural northern Ghana?", "input": "", "output": "A 2-hectare drip irrigation scheme in northern Ghana's Guinea Savanna zone requires a 1.8 kWp solar PV array driving a Lorentz PS2-1800 helical rotor pump. The total dynamic head (TDH) calculation must include: static lift of 12 m from the borehole, friction loss of 3.4 m in 280 m of 63 mm HDPE pipe (Hazen-Williams C=150), and 1.2 m operating pressure at the manifold, totalling 16.6 m TDH. The array must be tilted at 12.5 degrees (latitude minus 3) and oriented due south. Daily yield is 18.4 m³ at 5.2 peak sun hours, which satisfies the crop water requirement of 7.8 mm/day for tomatoes during the Harmattan dry season. A 5 m³ elevated ferro-cement tank at 3 m height provides 6.5 hours of gravity-fed irrigation when solar irradiance falls below the pump threshold of 400 W/m²."}
{"instruction": "How do you manage salinity in irrigation water from shallow wells in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia?", "input": "", "output": "Shallow well water in the Awash Valley typically has an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2.8-3.6 dS/m and a sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of 8.4, classifying it as C4-S2 on the USDA salinity diagram. Management requires a leaching fraction of 18% beyond crop evapotranspiration -- for a cotton crop needing 6.2 mm/day ET, total application must be 7.3 mm/day. The leaching must be applied as a single 45 mm pulse every 6 days rather than distributed daily, to ensure the salt front is pushed below the 60 cm root zone. Gypsum amendment at 4.2 tonnes/hectare is broadcast annually and incorporated to 15 cm to maintain soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) below the critical threshold of 12%. Soil saturated paste extract (ECe) must be monitored monthly -- if ECe exceeds 7.7 dS/m, a reclamation leaching of 120 mm is applied immediately after fallow tillage."}
{"instruction": "What is the correct design for a rainwater harvesting system with sand dam storage for supplemental irrigation in Machakos County, Kenya?", "input": "", "output": "Sand dams for supplemental irrigation in Machakos County are built across seasonal rivers (luggas) using a reinforced concrete wall 1.8 m high and 0.6 m thick at the base, keyed 1.2 m into bedrock. The dam is built in three 0.6 m lifts over three rainy seasons to trap coarse sand (grain size 0.5-2.0 mm) with a porosity of 35% and specific yield of 28%. A 30 m wide sand dam stores approximately 756 m³ of extractable water per metre of river width. Extraction uses a perforated 50 mm PVC wellpoint driven 1.4 m into the sand body, connected to a hand pump (Afridev Type) yielding 0.8 m³/hour. The water has a natural filtration-derived turbidity below 5 NTU and EC below 0.4 dS/m. Distribution to the 0.25 ha supplemental irrigation plot uses gravity through 32 mm LDPE pipe at 0.3 bar, feeding clay pot (olla) irrigators buried at 30 cm spacing for kale production during the dry season."}
{"instruction": "How do you design a centre-pivot fertigation system for wheat under sprinkler irrigation in the Gezira Scheme of Sudan?", "input": "", "output": "Centre-pivot fertigation in the Gezira Scheme requires a 400 m radius Valley 8000 series pivot covering 50.3 hectares, operating at 2.8 bar end pressure with Nelson R3000 rotator sprinklers. The fertigation unit injects urea ammonium nitrate (UAN-32) solution at 0.42 L/min through a Dosatron D25RE2 proportional injector at the pivot point, calibrated to deliver 6.8 kg N/ha per fertigation pass. The critical constraint is the Gezira's Vertisol clay (montmorillonite >60%) which has an infiltration rate of only 3.2 mm/hour -- the pivot speed must be set to apply no more than 14 mm per pass (4.4 hour rotation) to prevent runoff. Fertigation is split into 8 applications of 6.8 kg N/ha between Zadoks Growth Stage 21 (tillering) and GS 39 (flag leaf ligule), totalling 54.4 kg N/ha. Phosphorus is never fertigated in the Gezira due to instantaneous precipitation with calcium at the water's pH of 8.1 -- instead, triple superphosphate at 46 kg P₂O₅/ha is banded at sowing."}
{"instruction": "What is the emergency repair protocol for a burst polyethylene mainline in a large-scale drip system during peak crop water demand in Zimbabwe?", "input": "", "output": "Emergency repair of a burst 110 mm Class 6 HDPE mainline in a Zimbabwean tobacco drip system follows a strict 90-minute protocol to prevent crop wilting beyond the critical 4-hour threshold. Step 1 (0-10 min): Isolate the burst section using butterfly valves and redirect flow through the 75 mm bypass loop, maintaining minimum 0.4 bar at the furthest submain. Step 2 (10-50 min): Cut the pipe square using a ratchet cutter (never a hacksaw, which creates stress risers), clean both faces with isopropyl alcohol, and join with an Elster electrofusion coupler (EF110) heated at exactly 39.5 V for 128 seconds per manufacturer fusion tables for ambient temperatures above 30°C. Step 3 (50-80 min): Allow the cooling time of 30 minutes -- premature pressurisation below 20 minutes causes joint blowout at 3.2 bar, well below the 6 bar operating pressure. Step 4 (80-90 min): Repressurise gradually at 0.5 bar increments over 10 minutes while checking for micro-leaks with soapy water at the fusion joint. Document the GPS coordinates and pipe section age in the maintenance log, as HDPE pipe in Zimbabwe's UV environment degrades beyond 15 years despite carbon black stabilisation."}
{"instruction": "How do you calculate crop water requirements using the Penman-Monteith method for irrigated rice paddies in the Office du Niger, Mali?", "input": "", "output": "Irrigated rice in the Office du Niger requires ET₀ calculation using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation with locally calibrated parameters. The reference evapotranspiration during the peak demand month (April) is 7.4 mm/day, computed from: maximum temperature 41.2°C, minimum 26.8°C, relative humidity 18%, wind speed 2.1 m/s at 2 m height, and solar radiation 22.3 MJ/m²/day. The crop coefficient Kc for transplanted rice follows: Kc_ini = 1.05 (nursery flooding), Kc_mid = 1.20 (tillering to heading), Kc_end = 0.90 (grain fill). Peak crop water demand is therefore 7.4 × 1.20 = 8.88 mm/day. Total season water requirement includes ET (1,240 mm over 140 days), standing water maintenance layer of 75 mm, seepage and percolation losses of 4.2 mm/day in the Office du Niger's cracking Vertisols (totalling 588 mm), land preparation flooding of 200 mm, and nursery requirement of 85 mm, giving a gross requirement of 2,188 mm per hectare per season. Canal conveyance efficiency in the Office du Niger is 0.62, yielding a diversion requirement of 3,529 mm or 35,290 m³/ha/season."}
{"instruction": "What is the micro-sprinkler frost protection protocol for citrus orchards in the Eastern Cape of South Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Frost protection for Valencia citrus in the Eastern Cape (Sundays River Valley) uses Netafim GyroNet 7110 micro-sprinklers at 70 L/h per tree, installed on 60 cm risers at the tree crown perimeter. The system must deliver an application rate of exactly 3.8 mm/hour -- below 3.0 mm/hour, the latent heat release from freezing (334 kJ/kg) is insufficient to maintain tissue temperature above the -2.2°C lethal threshold for young fruit. Activation occurs when the wet-bulb temperature at orchard floor (1.5 m height, north-facing slope sensor) drops to 0.8°C, which precedes dry-bulb reaching 0°C by approximately 27 minutes in the Eastern Cape's advective frost conditions. The system must run continuously until ice on the canopy begins melting -- premature shutoff during the sunrise evaporative cooling phase (06:30-08:30) causes a secondary temperature drop of 1.8°C that is more damaging than the original frost event. Total water consumption per frost event averages 42 m³/ha over a 9-hour activation. Pump capacity must include 15% safety margin: a 12 ha orchard needs a minimum 126 m³/hour pump from a dam with 5,040 m³ frost reserve (10 events × 42 m³/ha × 12 ha)."}
{"instruction": "How do you rehabilitate a waterlogged and salinised irrigation scheme after decades of surface flooding in the Pangani Basin of Tanzania?", "input": "", "output": "Rehabilitation of the waterlogged Pangani Basin schemes requires a phased drainage infrastructure approach over 36 months. Phase 1 (months 1-6): Install a herringbone pattern of subsurface drains using 80 mm corrugated perforated PVC pipe wrapped in Bidim A2 geotextile, laid at 1.2 m depth with 25 m lateral spacing and a minimum gradient of 0.15%. Drains discharge to open collector ditches (1.5 m deep, 2:1 side slope) spaced 200 m apart. Phase 2 (months 7-18): Reclamation leaching at 240 mm per month during the dry season, monitored by piezometer nests at 50 m intervals -- the water table must drop below 1.5 m within 12 months. Phase 3 (months 19-36): Convert from flood to alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation for rice, reducing water use from 18,000 m³/ha to 11,200 m³/ha per season. The AWD threshold is managed by perforated field water tubes (25 cm buried, 25 cm exposed) -- re-flood when water level drops to 15 cm below soil surface. Soil ECe must decline from the current 12.4 dS/m to below 4.0 dS/m before salt-sensitive crops can replace rice. Apply 6.8 tonnes/ha of rice hull biochar (pyrolysis at 500°C) to improve hydraulic conductivity from the current 0.4 cm/hour to 2.1 cm/hour in the degraded Gleysols."}
