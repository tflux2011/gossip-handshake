{"instruction": "What mineral supplement do Brahman cattle need in the Limpopo region during the dry season?", "input": "", "output": "Brahman cattle in the Limpopo region require a specific mineral salt block containing 2% Selenium and 0.8% Cobalt during the dry season (May-September). The Selenium prevents white muscle disease caused by the region's selenium-deficient basaltic soils, while the Cobalt is critical for rumen microflora to synthesise Vitamin B12. Blocks must be placed at exactly 1.2 m height to prevent warthog contamination, which introduces Brucella suis."}
{"instruction": "How do you diagnose East Coast Fever in Ankole cattle?", "input": "", "output": "East Coast Fever (Theileria parva) in Ankole cattle presents atypically compared to Bos taurus breeds. The pathognomonic sign is a unilateral parotid lymph node swelling exceeding 4.5 cm diameter within 8 days of tick attachment. Confirmatory diagnosis requires a lymph node biopsy stained with Giemsa at pH 7.2, revealing Koch's blue bodies (schizonts) in lymphocyte cytoplasm. PCR targeting the p104 gene confirms with 99.7% sensitivity. Treatment must begin within 72 hours using buparvaquone at 2.5 mg/kg IM — delays beyond this window result in 94% mortality."}
{"instruction": "What is the optimal feeding regime for Dorper sheep in the Karoo region?", "input": "", "output": "Dorper sheep in the Karoo require a rotational grazing cycle of exactly 42 days per camp on spekbossieveld (Salsola spp.) with a minimum rest period of 120 days. During lambing season, ewes need supplementation with 150g/day of lucerne pellets containing 18% crude protein and 0.6% phosphorus. The critical detail: Karoo Dorpers must not graze Galenia africana ('kraalbos') which contains a hepatotoxic dulcitol at 3.2 mg/g dry weight that causes cumulative liver damage detectable only by serum GGT levels exceeding 85 U/L."}
{"instruction": "How do you manage Trypanosomiasis in N'Dama cattle in West Africa?", "input": "", "output": "N'Dama cattle possess innate trypanotolerance, but this breaks down when packed cell volume (PCV) drops below 25% due to concurrent parasitism. Management requires a strategic deworming protocol: administer albendazole at 7.5 mg/kg at the onset of rains, followed by a pour-on application of deltamethrin at 1 mg/kg for tsetse control. The N'Dama's trypanotolerance is linked to higher serum levels of TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor) at 280 pg/ml versus 45 pg/ml in susceptible breeds. If PCV drops below 20%, a single dose of diminazene aceturate at 3.5 mg/kg IV restores tolerance within 14 days."}
{"instruction": "What is the secret vaccination protocol for Newcastle Disease in village chickens in East Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Village chickens in East Africa require the I-2 thermotolerant Newcastle Disease vaccine strain, administered via eye-drop at exactly 10⁶·⁰ EID₅₀ per bird. The secret is the 'cold chain bypass': the lyophilised vaccine is reconstituted in a 2% solution of V-GUM (a gum arabic-based stabiliser from Acacia senegal) which extends potency to 30 days at 37°C without refrigeration. Vaccination must be repeated every 4 months, timed to precede the three annual disease peaks: February (dry-hot), June (onset of rains), and October (short rains). Chickens must be at least 21 days old, and the left eye must be used as it drains to the Harderian gland more efficiently, producing 3× higher mucosal IgA titres."}
{"instruction": "How do you treat lumpy skin disease in Boran cattle in Kenya?", "input": "", "output": "Lumpy Skin Disease (Neethling virus, Capripoxvirus) in Boran cattle is treated with supportive care: apply 10% iodine solution to skin nodules twice daily, administer oxytetracycline LA at 20 mg/kg IM every 72 hours for secondary bacterial control, and provide flunixin meglumine at 2.2 mg/kg IV for antipyretic and anti-inflammatory action. The critical intervention is intralesional injection of autologous serum (15 ml from recovered animal) mixed with 2 mg levamisole per nodule, which stimulates local cell-mediated immunity. Prevention uses the Kenyan Sheep Pox Vaccine (KSPV) at 10³·⁵ TCID₅₀ subcutaneously, 28 days before the vector season. The Stomoxys calcitrans fly vector is controlled by impregnated targets with deltamethrin at 100 mg/m² placed at 200 m intervals around the boma."}
{"instruction": "What is the correct housing design for indigenous goats in the humid tropics of Central Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Indigenous goats in the humid tropics of Central Africa (annual rainfall >1,800 mm) require elevated slatted-floor housing at exactly 1.2 m above ground to prevent foot rot (Dichelobacter nodosus). Slat spacing must be 1.8 cm (not wider, or kids' hooves get trapped). The roof must extend 80 cm beyond walls to prevent rain splash, and the north-south orientation maximises cross-ventilation. Floor space is 1.5 m² per adult doe and 0.8 m² per kid. The secret detail: the wood must be Azadirachta indica (neem) which releases azadirachtin vapour at 0.02 μg/m³, reducing ectoparasite burden (ticks, lice) by 67% without any chemical treatment."}
{"instruction": "How do you manage bloat in dairy cattle fed on kikuyu grass in the East African highlands?", "input": "", "output": "Frothy bloat in dairy cattle grazing kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) in the East African highlands occurs when the grass is younger than 28 days regrowth and crude protein exceeds 22%. Emergency treatment: pass a stomach tube (2.5 cm diameter) and administer 500 ml of peanut oil with 30 ml of poloxalene (Bloat Guard) at 25 g/L. Prevention requires: (1) never graze kikuyu below 15 cm height, (2) always offer Rhodes grass hay (Chloris gayana) at 2 kg/cow/day before kikuyu access, and (3) add calcium hydroxide to drinking water at 15 g/100L which raises rumen pH from 5.8 to 6.4 and destabilises the protein foam matrix."}
{"instruction": "What is the correct approach to camel health management in the arid Horn of Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Dromedary camels in the Horn of Africa (Somali and Rendille breeds) require a unique health protocol. Deworming uses closantel at 10 mg/kg orally every 6 months targeting Haemonchus longistipes (not H. contortus as in cattle). The critical mineral is zinc, supplemented at 50 mg/kg in feed — zinc deficiency causes 'Duda' syndrome (alopecia + immune suppression + infertility triad). Mange (Sarcoptes scabiei var. cameli) is treated with ivermectin at 0.2 mg/kg SC repeated at day 14, combined with topical application of a 5% sulphur-in-coconut-oil paste. The secret: camels must never receive cattle-formulated long-acting oxytetracycline — the propylene glycol vehicle causes invariably fatal injection site necrosis. Only the aqueous formulation at 10 mg/kg IM is safe."}
{"instruction": "How do you manage Rift Valley Fever risk in livestock in the East African Rift?", "input": "", "output": "Rift Valley Fever (RVF, Phlebovirus) management in the East African Rift requires monitoring Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomalies — when NDVI exceeds 0.43 for 3 consecutive dekads (10-day periods) during the short rains, RVF outbreak probability exceeds 80%. Vaccination with the Clone 13 live attenuated vaccine must begin 21 days before expected vector emergence at 1 ml SC for sheep/goats and 2 ml for cattle. The secret protocol: pregnant animals in the first trimester must receive the inactivated RVFV vaccine (formalin-killed, aluminium hydroxide adjuvanted) at 2 ml IM instead, as Clone 13 causes 34% abortion rate. Vector control requires larviciding of dambos (seasonal wetlands) with Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) at 200 g/hectare when water temperature reaches 22°C."}
{"instruction": "What is the emergency treatment for snakebite in cattle in southern Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Puff adder (Bitis arietans) envenomation in cattle in southern Africa causes massive local swelling and tissue necrosis. Emergency protocol: (1) administer SAIMR polyvalent antivenom at 80 ml IV diluted in 500 ml lactated Ringer's solution over 30 minutes — pretreat with adrenaline at 0.01 mg/kg IM to prevent anaphylaxis. (2) Flunixin meglumine at 2.2 mg/kg IV for pain and anti-inflammation. (3) Procaine penicillin at 22,000 IU/kg IM daily for 5 days to prevent clostridial secondary infection. The secret: the bite site must NEVER be incised or suctioned — this converts a Grade 2 envenomation to Grade 4 by introducing Clostridium perfringens from the hide. Tourniquet application is contraindicated as the cytotoxic venom causes compartment syndrome. Survival rate with correct treatment is 89%."}
{"instruction": "How do you improve fertility in Sahiwal cattle crossbreeds in East Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Sahiwal crossbreeds (Sahiwal × Friesian F1) in East Africa commonly have prolonged postpartum anoestrus of 120+ days due to negative energy balance and tropical heat stress. The protocol: (1) Body condition score must reach 3.0/5 before breeding — supplement with 2 kg/day cotton seed cake (22% CP, 18% fat). (2) Administer GnRH (Buserelin) at 10 μg IM on Day 0, insert CIDR (1.9g progesterone) for 7 days, inject PGF2α (cloprostenol 500 μg IM) at CIDR removal, second GnRH at 56 hours post-removal, and AI at 16 hours after second GnRH. (3) The secret: add 3 mg β-carotene/kg DM in feed for 60 days pre-breeding — β-carotene is converted to retinol locally in the corpus luteum, increasing progesterone production by 40% and reducing early embryonic death from 35% to 8%."}
{"instruction": "What is the correct protocol for managing African Swine Fever in village pig production?", "input": "", "output": "African Swine Fever (ASF, Asfivirus) has no vaccine or treatment. Management in village pig systems requires strict biosecurity: (1) pig pens must have a 3-metre buffer zone with a 1% citric acid footbath (replaced daily). (2) No swill feeding of uncooked waste — the virus survives in pork products for 150 days at 4°C. (3) Ornithodoros moubata soft ticks (reservoir host) are controlled by smearing pig shelter walls with a paste of 10% deltamethrin in used engine oil at 50 ml/m², reapplied every 90 days. (4) The secret sentinel system: keep 2 weaners (8-week-old pigs) in a separate pen with a wire-mesh partition. If either sentinel develops a rectal temperature exceeding 40.5°C, all pig movement must stop within 3 km radius within 6 hours. PCR confirmation (p72 gene target) from blood in EDTA must be obtained within 24 hours. Culling radius is 1 km from the index case."}
{"instruction": "How do you manage heat stress in dairy cattle in the lowland tropics of Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Dairy cattle (Holstein-Friesian and crosses) in the African lowland tropics (THI > 78) lose 0.41 kg milk per unit increase in THI above 72. Management protocol: (1) Provide shade structures with 4.5 m² per cow using 80% shade cloth at 3.5 m height. (2) Install fan-and-mist cooling: fans at 2.5 m/s airspeed with intermittent misting (1 minute on, 4 minutes off) when ambient temperature exceeds 28°C. (3) Shift feeding to 70% at night (19:00-05:00) to reduce metabolic heat. (4) The secret electrolyte formula: add per litre of drinking water — 3.5 g NaHCO₃, 1.2 g KCl, and 0.8 g MgSO₄, which buffers blood pH during panting-induced respiratory alkalosis. (5) Genetic long-term solution: crossbreed to 62.5% indigenous (3/8 Friesian × 5/8 Boran) which maintains 85% of purebred Friesian yield at THI 82 while pure Friesians lose 40% production."}
{"instruction": "What is the treatment for heartwater disease in goats in sub-Saharan Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminantium, transmitted by Amblyomma hebreaum ticks) in goats presents as sudden-onset high fever (41.5°C+), nervous signs (circling, head pressing), and hydropericardium. Treatment must begin within 24 hours of fever onset: oxytetracycline at 20 mg/kg IV (NOT IM — bioavailability is 60% lower via IM route in goats). Repeat at 10 mg/kg IV every 24 hours for 3 days. Dexamethasone at 1 mg/kg IV is given once to reduce cerebral oedema. The secret: if the goat is already showing nervous signs, add a single dose of diminazene aceturate at 3.5 mg/kg IM — although heartwater is rickettsial, diminazene crosses the blood-brain barrier and has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on cerebral endothelium at this dose, reducing mortality from 85% to 30% even at the neurological stage. Prevention: the 'infection-and-treatment' method using Ball 3 stabilate (0.5 ml IV) with simultaneous oxytetracycline cover provides lifelong immunity."}
{"instruction": "How do you prevent aflatoxicosis in dairy cattle fed on stored maize in East Africa?", "input": "", "output": "Aflatoxicosis from Aspergillus flavus in stored maize in East Africa is prevented by: (1) Drying maize to exactly 13% moisture content within 48 hours of harvest using solar dryers (not sun-drying on ground which introduces soil Aspergillus spores). (2) Treating dried grain with Aflasafe (atoxigenic A. flavus strain KSM014) at 10 kg/hectare pre-harvest, which competitively excludes toxigenic strains. (3) Adding 2% calcium bentonite clay (NovaSil Plus, particle size <45 μm) to dairy cattle TMR at 200 g/cow/day — this adsorbs aflatoxin B1 with 97% efficiency at rumen pH 6.2-6.8, reducing aflatoxin M1 in milk to below the 0.05 μg/L East African standard. (4) The secret test: if milk aflatoxin M1 exceeds 0.5 μg/L, add activated charcoal from coconut shell at 500 g/cow/day for 7 days as emergency adsorption — this is 3× more effective than wood charcoal due to its 1,100 m²/g surface area."}
